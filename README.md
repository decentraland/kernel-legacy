# Decentraland Kernel

## Contributing

**Please read the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)**

### Important

This repo requires `git lfs` to track images and other binary files. https://git-lfs.github.com/ and the latest version of GNU make, install it using `brew install make`

## Running locally

First, build the project:

    make build

To start hacking, run:

    make watch

To run the client in `debug` mode append the following query parameter to the URL:

    http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE

To run the client in first person perspective append the following query parameter to the URL:

    http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&fps

To spawn in a specific set of coordinates append the following query paramter:

    http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&fps&position=10,10

## Running tests

To run all the tests (and save new screenshots), run:

    make generate-images

To see test logs/errors directly in the browser, run:

    make watch and navigate to http://localhost:8080/test

### Visual tests

Visual tests are meant to work in a similar way as `snapshot tests`. Each time a test parcel changes the author is required to commit new screenshots along the other changes. These screenshots are then validated to detect regressions at the time of the pull request. To generate new snapshot images to compare run `npm run test:dry` (it requires docker)

### Test parcels

It is possible to define new parcels inside this repo for testing purposes. To do so, create a new folder in `public/test-scenes`. There are several conventions to be followed regarding the name of these folders and the positions of the parcels, these can be found in the [README](https://github.com/decentraland/client/blob/master/public/test-scenes/README.md) file.

To edit and make sure that `make watch` is rebuilding the scene when you are hacking on a new feature of the kernel, make sure to modify `targets/scenes/basic-scenes.json` and point to the scene you're working on.

All test parcels can be accessed inside visual tests:

```ts
import { loadTestParcel } from 'test/testHelpers'

describe('My example test', function() {
  loadTestParcel(200, 10)
  // ...
```

# To update babylon version

Run `./scripts/updateBabylon.sh VERSION`, usually to develop we run `./scripts/updateBabylon.sh preview`

For releases we should run `./scripts/updateBabylon.sh latest` before.

> Requires `jq` install using `brew install jq`
